    <p class="text-xl text-white max-w-[600px] text-center">I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for understanding how technology shapes the world and solving problems through code. Whether it’s understanding how things work or building simple tools, I’m always curious about the logic and structure behind tech. In my journey so far, I’ve had the opportunity to build a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving, while connecting with peers who share the same curiosity and drive. As I continue to grow and evolve in this space, I’m excited to contribute to projects that push boundaries and to be part of a community that thrives on innovation and learning.
